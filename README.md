# RNBO Webpage Sampling Example

This sample code records the browser's audio input and plays it in MIDI.

You can access it here to see how it works.

Try changing your browser's audio input settings.

# Code Changes

Referring to the following page, we added code to create a media stream and connect it to the RNBO device.

https://rnbo.cycling74.com/learn/working-with-web-audio-contexts

```javascript
// Connect mic-input to the device.node
navigator.mediaDevices
  .getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: false })
  .then((stream) => {
    UserMediaSource = context.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
    UserMediaSource.connect(device.node);
  });
```

# Requires a secure connection

When hosting a web page exported by RNBOã€€Web Export, it must be accessible via https. Otherwise, the external input will probably not work.
